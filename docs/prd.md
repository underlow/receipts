# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Purpose & Scope
**Purpose**  
Enable individuals and families to digitize, review, and manage household (and other) expenses via receipt and bill images, automated OCR extraction, manual approval, and rich reporting.

**Scope**
- Receipt and Bill ingestion (via web UI)
- OCR via OpenAI, Claude, Google AI, or STUB for development
- Manual review & approval for Receipts and Bills
- Association of Receipts with Bills
- Payment record management (one-off & recurring)
- Attachments & comments
- Reporting & exports (CSV/Excel)
- Admin settings (OCR engines, API keys)

## Main User Scenarios & Stories
1. **Ingest Receipt/Bill**
    - *As a user*, I want to upload via UI so that I donâ€™t have to manually enter data.
2. **Review Extraction**
    - *As a user*, I want to edit or approve OCR-extracted data from receipts or bills to ensure accuracy before payment.
3. **Associate Receipt with Bill**
    - *As a user*, I want to associate one or more receipts with a specific bill, or create a new bill from a receipt.


## Entities

### User 
#### User data
 - name 
 - email
 - avatar
#### User state
User do not have states.
#### User behaviour
User can log in into system only if its email in the list of allowed emails.

### InboxEntity
#### InboxEntity data
 - id: unique identifier for the inbox item
 - uploadedImage: path to the uploaded image file
 - uploadDate: timestamp when the document was uploaded
 - ocrResults: OCR extracted text results (nullable)
 - linkedEntityId: ID of the created bill or receipt entity (nullable)
 - linkedEntityType: type of entity created (BILL or RECEIPT, nullable)
 - state: current state of the inbox item (InboxState)
 - failureReason: reason for OCR failure (nullable)
#### InboxEntity state
InboxEntity can be in the following states:
 - CREATED: Just uploaded, OCR processing pending
 - PROCESSED: OCR processing completed successfully
 - FAILED: OCR processing failed
 - APPROVED: User approved, bill or receipt created
#### InboxEntity behaviour
InboxEntity represents uploaded documents in the processing workflow:
 - InboxEntity can be created when user uploads an image
 - InboxEntity transitions from CREATED to PROCESSED after successful OCR
 - InboxEntity transitions from CREATED to FAILED when OCR fails
 - InboxEntity transitions from PROCESSED to APPROVED when user approves
 - InboxEntity transitions from FAILED back to CREATED for retry
 - InboxEntity validates state transitions (canApprove, canRetry)
 - InboxEntity links to created bills or receipts via linkedEntityId

### Bill
#### Bill data
 - id: unique identifier for the bill
 - serviceProviderId: identifier of the service provider
 - billDate: date of the bill
 - amount: monetary amount of the bill (BigDecimal)
 - inboxEntityId: optional link to the inbox entity (if created from OCR)
 - state: current state of the bill (BillState)
 - createdDate: timestamp when the bill was created
 - description: optional description for the bill
#### Bill state
Bills can be in the following states:
 - CREATED: Bill exists and is active, can be modified and managed
 - REMOVED: Bill has been deleted and is no longer active
#### Bill behaviour
Bills represent financial obligations that users need to track and manage:
 - Bills can be created from approved inbox items (linking to OCR process)
 - Bills can be created manually without inbox item
 - Bills can be removed (transition to REMOVED state)
 - Bills can have their amount updated (must be greater than zero)
 - Bills can have their service provider updated
 - Bills track validation states (canRemove, isActive)
