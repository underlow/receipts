# Bill and Receipt Detail Views - Feature Implementation

## Motivation
Users need detailed interfaces to review, edit, and process individual bills and receipts after they've been uploaded and processed through OCR. The inbox provides a high-level overview, but users require focused detail views to:
- Review and correct OCR-extracted data
- Associate receipts with bills for better organization
- Approve items and convert them to payments
- Make precise edits with visual reference to the original document

## Feature Description

### Bill Detail View (`/bills/{billId}`)
A split-pane interface for processing individual bills with OCR data and payment creation capabilities.

**Left Pane - Image Viewer:**
- Zoomable bill image with pan and zoom controls
- Rotate functionality (90-degree increments)
- Reset view controls
- Responsive design that scales with window size

**Right Pane - Bill Information & Forms:**
- **Bill Metadata**: Filename, upload date, and current status
- **OCR Extracted Data**: Editable fields for provider, amount, and date
- **Payment Information**: Service provider, payment method, amount, currency, dates, and comments
- **Associated Receipts**: Thumbnail gallery of linked receipts
- **Action Buttons**: Save Draft, Accept as Payment, Reject

### Receipt Detail View (`/receipts/{receiptId}`)
A split-pane interface for managing receipt associations and standalone payment creation.

**Left Pane - Image Viewer:**
- Identical image viewer functionality as bills
- Zoomable receipt image with controls
- Rotate and reset functionality

**Right Pane - Receipt Information & Forms:**
- **Receipt Status**: Standalone vs. Associated with Bill
- **Bill Association**: Dropdown to link with existing bills or remove associations
- **Associated Bill Display**: Visual summary of linked bill with navigation
- **Payment Information**: For standalone receipts - service provider, method, amounts, dates
- **Action Buttons**: Update Association, Save Draft, Accept as Payment

## Implementation Details

### Service Layer
- **BillService**: Bill operations, OCR data handling, approval/rejection workflow
- **ReceiptService**: Receipt operations, bill associations, standalone processing
- **PaymentService**: Payment creation from approved bills and standalone receipts
- **ServiceProviderService**: Service provider management and dropdown data
- **PaymentMethodService**: Payment method management and dropdown data

### Controller Layer
- **BillController**: 
  - `GET /bills/{billId}` - Show bill detail page
  - `POST /bills/api/{billId}/save-draft` - Save form edits
  - `POST /bills/api/{billId}/approve` - Approve and create payment
  - `POST /bills/api/{billId}/reject` - Reject bill
  - `GET /bills/api/{billId}` - Get bill data for AJAX
- **ReceiptController**:
  - `GET /receipts/{receiptId}` - Show receipt detail page
  - `POST /receipts/api/{receiptId}/associate` - Update bill association
  - `POST /receipts/api/{receiptId}/accept-as-payment` - Create payment from receipt
  - `POST /receipts/api/{receiptId}/save-draft` - Save form edits
  - `GET /receipts/api/{receiptId}` - Get receipt data for AJAX

### Data Transfer Objects
- **BillDetailDto**: Bill data with associated receipts and URLs
- **ReceiptDetailDto**: Receipt data with bill association options
- **PaymentDetailDto**: Payment information with provider/method details
- **ServiceProviderDto/Option**: Service provider dropdown data
- **PaymentMethodDto/Option**: Payment method dropdown data
- **Operation Response DTOs**: Standardized API responses

### UI Templates
- **bill-detail.html**: Responsive split-pane template with modern styling
- **receipt-detail.html**: Responsive split-pane template with association features
- Both templates include:
  - Professional CSS styling with responsive design
  - JavaScript for image controls (zoom, rotate, reset)
  - AJAX operations with loading states and user feedback
  - Form validation and auto-population logic

### Security & User Experience
- **Authentication**: All operations verify OAuth2 user authentication
- **Authorization**: User ownership verification for all entities
- **User Feedback**: Success/error messages with auto-dismiss
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during AJAX operations
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: For destructive actions (approve, reject, delete)
- **Navigation**: Seamless integration with inbox via "Detail" buttons

## Definition of Done

### Test Cases Implemented âœ…
1. **Compilation Tests**: All code compiles without errors
2. **Service Layer Tests**: Business logic verification through existing test suite
3. **Security Tests**: User authentication and authorization verification
4. **Integration Tests**: Controller and service integration through Spring Boot tests

### Test Cases to Verify Manually
1. **Bill Detail View Navigation**: 
   - [ ] Navigate from inbox to bill detail view via "Detail" button
   - [ ] Verify image loads correctly and controls work (zoom, rotate, reset)
   - [ ] Verify OCR data displays in editable form fields
   - [ ] Test save draft functionality
   - [ ] Test approve bill with payment creation
   - [ ] Test reject bill functionality

2. **Receipt Detail View Navigation**:
   - [ ] Navigate to receipt detail view
   - [ ] Test receipt-bill association functionality
   - [ ] Test removing bill associations
   - [ ] Test standalone receipt payment creation
   - [ ] Verify associated bill display and navigation

3. **Form Functionality**:
   - [ ] Auto-population of amount and date fields
   - [ ] Service provider and payment method dropdowns work correctly
   - [ ] Form validation prevents invalid submissions
   - [ ] Draft saving persists data correctly

4. **User Interface**:
   - [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
   - [ ] Image viewer controls function properly
   - [ ] Loading states display during operations
   - [ ] Success/error messages appear and dismiss correctly
   - [ ] Navigation between detail views and back to inbox works

5. **Security**:
   - [ ] Users can only access their own bills and receipts
   - [ ] Authentication is required for all operations
   - [ ] AJAX operations maintain security context

## Technical Notes

### Current Limitations
1. **File Type Mapping**: The current implementation assumes IncomingFiles map to Bills, but the actual conversion logic may need refinement
2. **Navigation Flow**: Direct URL access to detail views requires existing Bill/Receipt entities
3. **Image Serving**: Uses existing file serving infrastructure with `/api/bills/{id}/image` and `/api/receipts/{id}/image` endpoints

### Future Enhancements
1. **OCR Integration**: Connect detail views with actual OCR processing results
2. **Bulk Operations**: Process multiple items from detail views
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard navigation for power users
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience for detail views
5. **Audit Trail**: Track changes made in detail views
