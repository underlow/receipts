We need to add a new feature: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:

1. Understand the requirements described
2. Analyse how it will fit into current requirements 
3. challenge requirements. ask questions if needed. 
3. Show me all requirements in @./docs/prd.md document which will be affected by this new feature. elaborate with me this  
4. Show me all requirements in @./docs/prd.md document which will conflict with this new feature. elaborate with me this until all conflicts are resolved
5. think if it is possible to split this issue to smaller ones which can be implemented separately. 
6. provide a plan to implement feature, plan should be concrete and should be made of smallest possible steps. each step should be one change that can be delivered
7. after plan confirmed create github tickets. when creating tickets you have to decide if we need set of separate tickets or one umbrella tickets with sub-tickets  
8. plan in each ticket should contain items (where applicable)
   - write tests
   - update documentation

Remember to use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks.
