# Feature Implementation: Domain Entities (Item 6)

## Motivation

The core domain model is essential for the receipt processing application, providing the foundational data structures needed to manage service providers, payment methods, bills, receipts, and payments. This implementation establishes the complete entity relationship model required for expense tracking and bill management.

## Feature Description

Implemented a comprehensive domain model with five core entities and supporting infrastructure:

### Core Entities

1. **ServiceProvider**: Represents companies/services that users pay bills to
   - Fields: id, name, category, defaultPaymentMethod, isActive, comment
   - Purpose: Organize and categorize expense providers (utilities, subscriptions, etc.)

2. **PaymentMethod**: Represents different ways users pay bills
   - Fields: id, name, type (enum), comment
   - Types: CARD, BANK, CASH, OTHER
   - Purpose: Track payment mechanisms for expense analysis

3. **Bill**: Represents uploaded receipt/bill documents
   - Fields: id, filename, filePath, uploadDate, status (enum), ocrRawJson, extractedAmount, extractedDate, extractedProvider, userId
   - Status workflow: PENDING → PROCESSING → APPROVED/REJECTED
   - Purpose: Store and process uploaded documents through OCR pipeline

4. **Receipt**: Represents individual expense items
   - Fields: id, userId, billId (nullable FK)
   - Purpose: Flexible organization allowing multiple receipts per bill or standalone receipts

5. **Payment**: Represents finalized, approved transactions
   - Fields: id, serviceProviderId, paymentMethodId, amount, currency, invoiceDate, paymentDate, billId, userId, comment
   - Purpose: Approved expenses ready for reporting and analysis

### Supporting Infrastructure

- **Enum Classes**: BillStatus and PaymentMethodType for type safety
- **Repository Layer**: Complete CRUD operations with Spring Data JDBC
- **Database Schema**: Liquibase migration with constraints and indexes
- **Validation**: Jakarta Bean Validation for data integrity

## Definition of Done

### Database Schema
✅ All entity tables created with proper constraints  
✅ Foreign key relationships established  
✅ Check constraints for enum values  
✅ Performance indexes on key columns  
✅ Liquibase migration successfully applied  

### Entity Implementation  
✅ All entities implemented as Kotlin data classes  
✅ Jakarta validation annotations applied  
✅ Proper null safety and type constraints  
✅ Spring Data JDBC compatibility (no JPA annotations)  
✅ Immutable design with copy methods  

### Repository Layer
✅ Repository interfaces defined for all entities  
✅ JdbcTemplate implementations following existing patterns  
✅ CRUD operations: save, findById, findAll, delete  
✅ Custom finder methods (findByUserId, findByServiceProviderId, etc.)  
✅ Proper error handling and null safety  
✅ Spring bean configuration in JdbcConfig  

### Testing
✅ Unit tests for all domain entities  
✅ Repository interface testing  
✅ Enum functionality verification  
✅ Validation constraint testing  
✅ Test-driven development approach (red-green-refactor)  
✅ All tests passing with good coverage  

### Documentation
✅ Architecture documentation updated  
✅ Entity relationship diagrams  
✅ Changelog entries  
✅ Feature implementation documentation  
✅ Overview documentation created  

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Design ✅
- Analyzed entity requirements from plan
- Designed normalized schema with proper relationships
- Created Liquibase migration with tables, constraints, and indexes
- Ensured PostgreSQL compatibility and performance optimization

### Step 2: Enum Classes ✅
- Created BillStatus enum (PENDING, PROCESSING, APPROVED, REJECTED)
- Created PaymentMethodType enum (CARD, BANK, CASH, OTHER)
- Verified enum serialization/deserialization

### Step 3: Entity Models ✅
- Implemented all entities as Kotlin data classes
- Added Jakarta validation annotations
- Ensured immutability and type safety
- Applied proper null handling

### Step 4: Repository Layer ✅
- Created repository interfaces with CRUD operations
- Implemented repositories using JdbcTemplate
- Added custom finder methods for business logic
- Updated JdbcConfig for Spring bean registration

### Step 5: Testing ✅
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests
- Followed TDD approach (red-green-refactor)
- Verified validation constraints
- Tested repository functionality

### Step 6: Documentation ✅
- Updated architecture documentation
- Added entity relationship information
- Created comprehensive changelog entries
- Generated feature implementation documentation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Entity Relationships
```
Users ──┬── LoginEvents (existing)
        ├── Bills ──┬── Receipts (optional)
        ├── Receipts    └── Payments (optional)
        └── Payments ──┬── ServiceProviders
                       └── PaymentMethods
```

### Database Schema Highlights
- Primary keys: BIGSERIAL for PostgreSQL compatibility
- Foreign keys: Proper cascade and constraint handling
- Check constraints: Enum value validation at database level
- Indexes: Performance optimization for common queries
- Null handling: Strategic nullable fields for flexibility

### Repository Pattern
- Interface-based design for testability
- JdbcTemplate for direct SQL control
- RowMapper implementations for type safety
- GeneratedKeyHolder for auto-generated IDs
- Consistent error handling

### Validation Strategy
- Entity-level validation with Jakarta annotations
- Business rule enforcement (@Positive for amounts)
- Required field validation (@NotNull, @NotBlank)
- Database-level constraints as backup

## Verification

### Database Migration
```sql
-- Verified tables created successfully
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name IN 
('service_providers', 'payment_methods', 'bills', 'receipts', 'payments');
```

### Repository Testing
- All CRUD operations tested
- Custom finder methods verified
- Spring bean configuration confirmed
- Database integration successful

### Entity Validation
- Required field constraints enforced
- Business rules validated (positive amounts)
- Enum type safety confirmed
- Null handling properly implemented

## Next Steps

With the domain entities complete, the next logical steps are:

1. **Item 8: Folder-watcher service** - File ingestion for Bill entities
2. **Item 9: Web-UI upload endpoint** - Manual file upload for Bills
3. **Item 10-12: OCR Integration** - Process uploaded Bills with AI engines
4. **Item 13-14: Inbox Review UI** - User interface for Bill/Receipt management

The domain model provides the foundation for all subsequent features in the receipt processing workflow.
