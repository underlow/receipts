# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Purpose & Scope
**Purpose**  
Enable individuals and families to digitize, review, and manage household (and other) expenses via receipt and bill images, automated OCR extraction, manual approval, and rich reporting.

**Scope**

- Admin settings (OCR engines, API keys)

## Main User Scenarios & Stories
1. **Ingest Receipt/Bill**
    - *As a user*, I want to upload via UI so that I donâ€™t have to manually enter data.
2. **Review Extraction**
    - *As a user*, I want to edit or approve OCR-extracted data from receipts or bills to ensure accuracy before payment.
3. **Associate Receipt with Bill**
    - *As a user*, I want to associate one or more receipts with a specific bill, or create a new bill from a receipt.
